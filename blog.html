    <strong>Assignment Zero</strong> (September 24rd, 2016)
    <p>First of all I can't believe I took more than 2 days to do this assignment. It seemed very simple at first but I had very limited experience with Git and Github and it was challenging to understand how all these various components work together with our assignment. I spent the maximum amout of time trying to understand how git and github work together and also configuring settings and managing files on the school servers so that all the various pages display accurately.
	 Some comphrensive guidance on git & github and how to properly configure it to work on our school servers should would have been useful so that the actual task of writing html code or learning it would be more enjoyable. 
         Finally, I was able to get everything setup properly with the help of a CS friend who fortunately has extensive experience in this domain. I was then able to focus on actually learning HTML and completing this assignment.I utilized the guide posted on Piazza for learning html and found it to be quite helpful. The assignment enabled me to improve my basic html skill and get started on learning git & github. In CS whenever we are learning something new its always challenging and sometimes theres a steep learning curve but once we succeed and get past those initial barriers the journey definitely seems worth it. So I look forwarding to continuing the course.  </p>
